## Definitions

 - A **Peer Reviewer** is an individual who ...

 - A **Review Manager** is an individual who assigns conference or journal submissions for review, oversees the reviewing process, and informs authors of decisions, typically a Program Chair, Associate Editor or Editor in Chief

 - **Reviewer Misconduct** refers to manipulating the peer review process, either as a peer reviewer or review manager, to produce adverse outcomes including inappropriate review content, rejection or acceptance of works when unjustified, or other inappropriate behaviours such as breach of confidentiality, impartiality and ethical standards and practices
 
 
## General Principles

 - Conflict of Interest
 - Discriminating against a protected group
 - Not adhering to required guidelines and practices
 - Subjective rather than objective reviewing practices
 - Failing to return reviews or returning manifestly inadequate reviews
 - Fake reviewing
 - Inappropriate management of the review process

## Specific Examples of Misconduct 
 
 - Using the review to promote work by the reviewer or their close colleagues, e.g., by demanding that authors add citations to one or more papers written by the reviewer or their close colleagues
 - Failing to declare conflict-of-interest and reviewing the submission anyway
 - Reviewing a submission when knowingly unable to be sufficiently objective in conducting the review
 - Prejudice dressed up as external validity concerns; e.g., dismissing a study because participants came from a developing country.
 - Distributing the submission to anyone not explicitly approved 
 - Failing to maintain confidentiality by, e.g., sharing the unpublished manuscript on social media
 - Submmitting a review without reading the submission
 - Submitting a manifestly inadequate review e.g. 1-2 lines; failing to address most of the review criteria
 - Stealing ideas from the submission and rejecting it so the reviewer can publish a similar paper first
 - Intentionally un-masking another anonymous reviewer to the authors
 - Ad hominem attacks on the authors
 - Accusing authors of misconduct (plagiarism, data fabrication, p-hacking, etc.) without compelling evidence
 - Rejecting works to reduce acceptance rates in order to increase 'prestige' of the venue
 - Deliberately praising the work and arguing for acceptance despite clear serious flaws as a favour to the authors
 - Rejecting submissions that don't have positive outcomes without justification
 - Rejecting submissions that disagree with the reviewers own viewpoints without justification
 - Disrespectful interactions with other reviewers, program chair or associate editor during discussion of a submission 
 - Deliberately assigning submisisons to reviewers known to be overly hostile or overly favourable to the authors / the submission topic
 - Suggesting reviewers when submitting with a known conflict of interest with the authors
 - Failing to treat genuine author concerns about a review with respect if review manager; failing to investigate a review complaint
 - Completing fake reviews of a submission for payment or other material gain

### The Line

Imagine a "line of misconduct." On the left side of the line are reviews that the authors perceive as rude, dismissive, unhelpful or unreasonable. On the right side of the line are reviews that any reasonable person would find unduly hostile and destructive in tone and substance. This line is difficult to pin down. Different reviewers (and cultures) express themselves in different ways. Some authors are more sensitive; others more thick-skinned.  We don't want to criminalize cultural differences. And yet, there exist reviews that are plainly over the line. Moving toward structured, standards-based reviews and away from unstructured free-text reviews may mitigate this problem.

## Specific Examples of Actions or Mistakes that do not Constitute Misconduct

 - Suggesting the authors look at papers not written by the reviewer or close colleagues, even if the authors perceive the papers as irrelevant   
 - Publicly sharing thoughts about a manuscript under review without disclosing important elements of the manuscript; e.g., tweeting "Reviewing yet another manuscript that reports "experiments" with no control groups - so frustrating!"
 - Failing to submit a review on time or at all 
 - Misunderstanding or deviating from a venue's peer review standards or procedures
 - Missing important elements of a paper, skimming sections, failing to engage with a paper as deeply as one should
 - Poorly explaining reasons for rejection
 - Writing a review that is perceived as unduly rude or blunt by the authors
 - Refusing to review a revision of a paper previously reviewed
 - Revealing the reviewer's own identity, intentionally or accidentally, during or after review

 
## Complaints Procedures

It is the responsibility of every venue for scholarly publishing to: 
 1. have a clear, publically available procedure for receiving, investigating and resolving complaints of reviewer misconduct
 2. ...
